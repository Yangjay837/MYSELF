        <h2>Memorable Childhood Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most cherished memories from my childhood is when l first sat at a computer lesson . I remember Miss Wali my computer studies teacher introduced us to the features of a computer such as monitor etc,through out my primary years she tried making the lessons joyful and memorable for us as the rumors instigated that computer studies was one of the hardest subjected to study. This experience taught me that with compassiontion,deterination ,passion and dedication one will conquer that which is seen hard,impossible or even difficult.

        <h2>Formative Moments</h2>
        <p>
            There were several formative moments in my childhood that contributed to my personal growth. One such moment was when the minister of education paid a visit to our school and donated 43 computers . This experience shaped my personality by wanting to be a great leader and one day donate as he did.
